//Book my show planning

//We need a reusable carousel
//-> Hero carousel
//-> Common carousel
//-> Cast and crew carousel 


//Pages
//->Home page
//->Movie page
//->Categories page
//->Auth Page
//->Razopay payment gateway

//Plan->How are we building it?
//1. Layout
//2. Routes
//3. Pages
//4. Components

//HOC: Higher order components : Componenst are something that accept props and states and return some jsx element. But HOC will return a component/function instead of jsx element. If we have class component it will return a class component, if function component then function component.

//Layout first approach:
